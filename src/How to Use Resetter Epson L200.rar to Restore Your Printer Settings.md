Congratulations! You have successfully reset your Epson L200 printer with Resetter Epson L200.rar. You should now be able to print without any errors. However, keep in mind that resetting your printer does not solve the problem of ink waste. You should still replace or clean your ink pads regularly to avoid overflowing and damaging your printer.
  
If you want to know how to clean your ink pads, you can follow these steps:

- Turn off your printer and unplug it from the power source.
- Open the printer cover and locate the ink pads. They are usually located at the bottom of the printer, under the print head.
- Use a pair of tweezers or a small tool to gently pull out the ink pads. Be careful not to damage them or spill any ink.
- Place the ink pads in a bowl of warm water and let them soak for a few minutes. You can also add some dish soap or vinegar to help dissolve the ink.
- Rinse the ink pads under running water until the water runs clear. Squeeze out any excess water and let them dry completely.
- Put the ink pads back into their slots and close the printer cover.
- Plug in your printer and turn it on. You may need to run a nozzle check or a head cleaning cycle to ensure proper printing quality.

Alternatively, you can also buy new ink pads from an authorized Epson dealer or online. Make sure you get the right size and model for your printer. To replace the ink pads, follow the same steps as above, but instead of cleaning them, just insert the new ones.
