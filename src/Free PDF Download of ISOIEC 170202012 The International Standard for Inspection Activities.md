# What is ISO/IEC 17020 and how to get it for free?
 
ISO/IEC 17020 is an international standard that specifies the requirements for the competence, impartiality and consistency of bodies performing inspection. It applies to inspection bodies of type A, B or C, as defined in the standard, and it covers any stage of inspection, such as design, type examination, initial inspection, in-service inspection or surveillance.
 
The standard aims to ensure that inspection bodies operate in a reliable and credible manner, and that they provide accurate and trustworthy inspection results. The standard also helps inspection bodies to demonstrate their competence to customers, regulators and accreditation bodies.

ISO/IEC 17020 was first published in 1998 and revised in 2012. The latest edition of the standard can be purchased from the ISO website[^3^] or from national standards bodies. However, some websites offer free downloads of the standard in pdf format. For example, one can find a free copy of the standard at Free Standards Download[^2^] or at Archive[^5^]. However, these websites may not be authorized by ISO or may not provide the most updated version of the standard. Therefore, users should exercise caution and verify the authenticity and validity of the downloaded documents before using them.
  
To apply ISO/IEC 17020 to an inspection body, the inspection body needs to implement a management system that meets the requirements of the standard. The management system should document the policies, procedures and processes that ensure the quality and consistency of the inspection activities. The management system should also include mechanisms for monitoring, reviewing and improving the performance of the inspection body.
 
One way to demonstrate the conformity of an inspection body to ISO/IEC 17020 is to seek accreditation from an accreditation body that is a signatory to the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) or the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC). Accreditation is a voluntary process that involves an independent assessment of the inspection body by a competent and impartial third party. Accreditation provides a formal recognition of the competence and credibility of the inspection body.
 
ISO/IEC 17020 accreditation can bring many benefits to an inspection body, such as:
 
- Enhancing the reputation and trustworthiness of the inspection body in the market;
- Increasing the confidence and satisfaction of customers and stakeholders;
- Reducing the risk of errors, complaints and disputes;
- Facilitating the acceptance of inspection results across borders and sectors;
- Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the inspection processes;
- Supporting the continuous improvement and innovation of the inspection body.

ISO/IEC 17020 defines three types of inspection bodies, based on their degree of independence and impartiality. These are:

1. Type A: An inspection body that is not involved in the design, manufacture, supply, installation, use or maintenance of the items it inspects, and that does not engage in any activities that may conflict with its inspection activities;
2. Type B: An inspection body that forms a separate and identifiable part of an organization that is involved in the design, manufacture, supply, installation, use or maintenance of the items it inspects, and that supplies inspection services only to its parent organization;
3. Type C: An inspection body that is involved in the design, manufacture, supply, installation, use or maintenance of the items it inspects, or that may engage in other activities that may conflict with its inspection activities, and that supplies inspection services to external parties or to other parts of its own organization.

The type of inspection body determines the level of requirements for its impartiality and independence. For example, type A inspection bodies have to meet more stringent requirements than type B or C inspection bodies. The standard also specifies different requirements for the structure, resources and processes of each type of inspection body.
