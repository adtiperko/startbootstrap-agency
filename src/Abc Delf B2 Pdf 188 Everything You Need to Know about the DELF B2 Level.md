- Do each activity carefully and try to answer as accurately and completely as possible. Use the CD for the listening section and follow the instructions given in the book.
- Check your answers with the solutions provided in the book. Pay attention to the feedback and explanations given for each task. Note down any errors or difficulties you encounter and review them later.
- Repeat the activities until you feel confident and comfortable with them. You can also try to do them faster or more fluently as you progress.
- Take the mock exam at the end of the book to evaluate your readiness for the real exam. Try to simulate the exam conditions as much as possible: set a timer, avoid distractions and use only the materials allowed in the exam.
- Analyze your results and identify any areas that need improvement. Review those topics or skills using other resources or with a teacher or tutor if possible.
