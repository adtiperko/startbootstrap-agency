The debug ROM was leaked online in 2005 by an anonymous source, and has since been archived and preserved by various websites and communities. However, not all versions of the debug ROM are the same. Some have been modified or patched to fix some errors or add some features, while others are unmodified and closer to the original leak. One way to tell them apart is by looking at the selection menus in the game. The modified versions have a different font and color scheme than the unmodified ones.
 
To play ZELOOTMA.Z64 96, you will need an emulator that can run Nintendo 64 games, such as Project64, Mupen64Plus, or RetroArch.

However, be careful when downloading ROM files from unknown or untrusted websites, as they may contain viruses or malware. Always scan your files before opening them with your emulator.
 
Once you have your emulator and ROM file ready, you can load the game and start playing. You can access the debug features by pressing different buttons on your controller or keyboard. For example, pressing L+R+Z will bring up the map selection menu, where you can warp to any location in the game. Pressing L+R+C-Left will bring up the item manipulation menu, where you can change your inventory and equipment. Pressing L+R+C-Right will bring up the camera mode menu, where you can switch between different perspectives and angles.

You can discover new secrets, explore unused areas, experiment with different items and abilities, and challenge yourself with harder dungeons and enemies. However, keep in mind that the debug ROM is not a finished product and may contain bugs, crashes, or errors that can affect your gameplay. Always save your progress frequently and back up your files before playing.
